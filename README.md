# Memoria

![](doc/thumbnail.jpg)
In this game, you take on the role of Jerome as you explore his mysterious past and unravel the truth behind his memories. The story begins as you enter a dark and shadowy house that was once Jerome's home with his lover, Maria. However, after their breakup three years ago, Maria died in secret and Jerome suffered a car accident a year ago that caused him to lose his memory. Now, Jerome must collect photo fragments to piece together his memories of Maria and ultimately decide the truth behind her death. As you guide Jerome through his past, the choices you make will determine the outcome of the game, leading to one of three different endings.

## How to play the game

To play the game, explore the house carefully and interact with objects using the mouse. Check the furniture on different floors and look for unusual things like fragmented pictures, fresh coffee, a dark second floor, and a locked drawer. Search inch-by-inch and find keys or fragments to unlock secrets. Solving puzzles can change the scene and reveal useful items. Pay attention to short words found and consider the furniture in the house. Make choices during the first visit to a memory, as they are final. Once choices are made, they can't be changed. Ultimately, reach one of the three different endings.
